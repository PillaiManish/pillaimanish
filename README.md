# Hey 👋, This is Manish Pillai
### About me 🤓


I have completed my engineering at Pillai College of Engineering, New Panvel. For the past 2 years, I have been working on back-end technologies. For around 6 months, I worked with Django, which is a Python web framework. And after that, I have been working on Laravel, a PHP framework, from making websites to building API's. I've even done Laravel internships.

Apart from this, the other things I know are the basic SQL commands and basic Git commands. Also, I have knowledge of hosting.

**Skills:** NodeJs | Laravel | Python 

- ✍️ I am trying to improve my problem solving skills 

- 🌱  I solve questions on Leetcode & do some projects for clients

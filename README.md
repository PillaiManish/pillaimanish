# Hey 👋, This is Manish Pillai
### About me 🤓


I am currently in my final year of engineering from Pillai College of Engineering, New Panvel. For the past 2 year, I have been working on back-end technologies. For around 6 months, I worked with Django which is a Python web framework. And after that, I have been working on Laravel, a PHP framework, from making website to building API's. I had done hosting a Laravel project which was based on fitness website. Even I have done internships on Laravel.
Apart from this, other things I know are the basic SQL commands and basic Git commands.

**Skills:** Laravel | C/C++ | Python 

- ✍️ I am trying to improve my problem solving skills 

- 🌱  I solve questions on Leetcode & do some projects for clients
